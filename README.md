# SQL Operations 

## Overview
This repository contains examples of various SQL operations performed on two tables: `StudentInfo` and `UniversityInfo`. Below is a breakdown of the tasks executed.

## Tables Created
- `StudentInfo`: Table storing information about students.
- `UniversityInfo`: Table storing information about universities.

## SQL Queries Executed
- **SELECT**: Used to retrieve specific data from the tables.
- **UPDATE**: Applied to modify existing data in the tables.
- **DELETE**: Employed to remove records from the tables.
- **ALTER**: Used to modify the structure of the tables, such as adding new columns.

## WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause was used to filter data based on specified conditions in the SQL queries.

## SQL Functions and Operators
- **BETWEEN**: Used to select values within a specified range.
- **MAX**: Used to retrieve the maximum value from a set of values.
- **MIN**: Used to retrieve the minimum value from a set of values.
- **COUNT**: Used to count the number of records meeting certain criteria.
- **AND, OR, NOT**: Logical operators used to combine conditions in WHERE clauses.

## Join Operations
- **INNER JOIN**: Used to retrieve records that have matching values in both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Used to retrieve all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table.
- **CROSS JOIN**: Used to produce a Cartesian product of the two tables.
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Used to retrieve all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table.
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Used to retrieve all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.

Each of these operations and queries contributed to manipulating and analyzing data stored in the `StudentInfo` and `UniversityInfo` tables within the SQL environment.
